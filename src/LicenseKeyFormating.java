     * Leetcode : 482
     *
     *Example 1:
     *
     * Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
     * Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
     * Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
     * Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
     * Output: "2-5G-3J"
     * Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
     *
     * Hint: Iterate from back and include - in between k lengths.
